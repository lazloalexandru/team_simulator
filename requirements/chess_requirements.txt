Chess project Requirements:
- I want a windows application
- write a design for a chess implementation in python. I want it to be playable by 2 users (human players). 
- this is a game running on a single PC and playeable by typing in "A2B3" like commands to make moves, so no fancy inputs needed. both players enter moves on same keyboard.
- game can use the special ASCII unicode characters to repsesent pieces. 
- table chess game state, and table state should be stored in a very memory efficient way, so in the future if I simulate 1000000 chess boards it uses the lowest possible amount of memory. I prefer to encode a piece in 4 bits (12 types of pieces ...) so a whole table row of 8 fields is encoded into a 32 bit integer by using bit logic.
