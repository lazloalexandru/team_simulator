I want a Windows application
I want a chess game implemented in python. I want it to be playable by 2 users (human players).
This is a game running on a single PC and playable by typing in "A2B3" like commands to make moves, so no fancy inputs needed. both players enter moves on same keyboard.
Use the special ASCII unicode characters to represent pieces.
Chess Table and game state should be stored in a very memory efficient way, so in the future if I simulate 1000000 chess boards it uses the lowest possible amount of memory. I prefer to encode a piece in 4 bits (12 types of pieces ...) so a whole table row of 8 fields is encoded into a 32-bit integer by using bit logic.
